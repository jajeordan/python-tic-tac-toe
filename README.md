# Python Tic Tac Toe

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. This project was created as a learning exercise to practice Python programming fundamentals.

## Features

- Command-line interface
- Two-player gameplay
- Board position numbering system for easy input
- Input validation and error handling
- Option to play multiple games
- Clear visual representation of the game board

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/python-tic-tac-toe.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd python-tic-tac-toe
```

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

2. The game board positions are numbered 1-9, from left to right, top to bottom:
```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

3. Players take turns entering a number (1-9) to place their mark (X or O)
4. The game ends when either:
   - A player wins by getting three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
   - The board is full (draw)
5. Choose to play again or exit when the game ends
